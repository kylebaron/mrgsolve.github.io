      <description>In NONMEM, $MIXTURE will allow you to estimate mixture models, where individuals are classified in to two or more populations with a certain probability. It is straightforward to simulate from models like these in your mrgsolve model code.
Two Populations Letâ€™s imagine there were two populations in the mixture model, with the second having smaller clearance than the first. In this example, we will develop some code for a simple model and then extend it to implement the mixture model component.</description>
