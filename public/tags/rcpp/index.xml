      <description>In NONMEM, $MIXTURE will allow you to estimate mixture models, where individuals are classified in to two or more populations with a certain probability. It is straightforward to simulate from models like these in your mrgsolve model code.
Two Populations Let’s imagine there were two populations in the mixture model, with the second having smaller clearance than the first. In this example, we will develop some code for a simple model and then extend it to implement the mixture model component.</description>

      <description>About  This model doesn’t really accomplish anything useful. I coded this up to show how we can get vector, matrix data as well as R functions into your simulation. After we show the model code, we walk through the key lines of code and explain why / where this type of extension could be useful.   Documentation  You can find documentation for functions in mrgx plugin here: http://mrgsolve.</description>
