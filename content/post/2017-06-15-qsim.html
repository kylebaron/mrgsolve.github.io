<p><code>qsim</code> is a function in <code>mrgsolve</code> that is similar to <code>mrgsim</code>, but quicker. In order to get that quickness, we lose some flexibility with the model. But in many circumstances, this is no big deal at all. <code>qsim</code> works with a regular model object, an event object, and (optionally) an <code>idata_set</code>. <code>qsim</code> returns simulations as a (plain/old) matrix so you will also have to do a little more work on the back end.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a benchmark. For the example, load a 2-cmt model and update the simulation end time. We’ll create a dosing event object (<code>ev</code>).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mod &lt;- mread(&quot;pk2cmt&quot;, modlib()) %&gt;% update(end=120)
ev &lt;- ev(amt=100, ii=24,addl=2)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we will pass the dosing event object into <code>recmatrix</code> along with the observation time grid (see <code>?stime</code>).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>recs &lt;- recmatrix(ev,stime(mod))
head(recs)</code></pre>
<pre><code>.      time cmt evid amt rate
. [1,]    0   0    0   0    0
. [2,]    0   0    1 100    0
. [3,]    1   0    0   0    0
. [4,]    2   0    0   0    0
. [5,]    3   0    0   0    0
. [6,]    4   0    0   0    0</code></pre>
<p><code>recmatrix</code> takes the dosing information in the event object, expands out all of the additional doses, schedules infusion end times (if <code>rate &gt; 0</code>) and inserts rows for observation records. So the <code>recs</code> object looks like a <code>data_set</code> but with slightly different information.</p>
<p>Let’s try the benchmark:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>benchmark(qsim(mod,recs),
          mrgsim(mod,events=ev),replications=300)[,c(1:4)]</code></pre>
<pre><code>.                       test replications elapsed relative
. 2 mrgsim(mod, events = ev)          300   0.989    3.341
. 1          qsim(mod, recs)          300   0.296    1.000</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>benchmark(qsim(mod,ev),
          mrgsim(mod,events=ev),replications=300)[,c(1:4)]</code></pre>
<pre><code>.                       test replications elapsed relative
. 2 mrgsim(mod, events = ev)          300   0.938    2.299
. 1            qsim(mod, ev)          300   0.408    1.000</code></pre>
<p>The idea is to fix all of that <strong>prior</strong> to running the simulation. It won’t always give you a huge savings (for example, if every simulation has a different design or dose, you have to call <code>recmatrix</code> every time). But it helps with replicate simulation when you can build the design once beforehand, and re-use for every replicate.</p>
<p>The time savings you get with <code>qsim</code> totally depend on the problem, including the duration of the simulation and the number of individuals.<br />
You might see a 100 speed up for simple simulation from a single set of parameters. Or a 30% speed up for long simulations in a big population. I would say you get the biggest speed up when it’s the shortest, simplest problem. Using <code>qsim</code> in that case gets you out of all the overhead <code>mrgsolve</code> needs in order to do complicated simulations.</p>
<p>But beware of the limitations here. <code>mrgsolve</code> will call <code>recmatrix</code> on the event object even if you don’t. <code>qsim</code> always uses a single regimen for a single fixed design with bioavability and infusion duration fixed prior to the problem.</p>
