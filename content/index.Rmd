`mrgsolve` is an `R` package for simulation from hierarchical, ordinary 
differential equation (ODE) based models typically employed in drug development.

## `mrgsolve` is free, open-source software
`mrgsolve` is distributed as a package for `R` and   <img src="/images/mrgsolve_sticker_812418_1.png" width="100px" align="right"> utilizes an ODE-solver from `ODEPACK` which is freely-available in the public domain.  We develop `mrgsolve` on [github](http://www.github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve), with input and contributions from the pharmacometrics modeling and simulation community.  We welcome feature requests and 
bug reports on the GitHub site [issue tracker](http://www.github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve/issues).

## An example

The following is a simple example to illustrate the basics of how `mrgsolve` works.  You can find more examples and usage vignettes in the links above or in the "Help Topics" menu in the nav bar at the top of the [mrgsolve.github.io](https://mrgsolve.github.io) main page.



```{r,message=FALSE}
library(mrgsolve)
```


First, a model object is created.  As an introduction, we will use a pre-coded model 
from an internal library.
```{r,message=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
mod <- mread("irm1", modlib())
```

An overview about this model
```{r,comment='.'}
mod
```

Next, let's create an intervention for the model.  We do this with an event object.
```{r}
e <- ev(amt=100, ii=24, addl=3)
```

Now, we simulate with our model object (`mod`) and the event object (`e`)
```{r,comment='.'}
out <- mod %>% ev(e) %>% mrgsim(end=240,delta=0.1)
out
```

And plot
```{r,"plot_1",fig.path="figures/index-"}
plot(out)  
```


The source code for this model:
```{r,comment=" ",echo=FALSE}
cat(mrgsolve:::code(mod),sep="\n")
```
